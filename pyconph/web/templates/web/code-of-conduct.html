            PyCon PH is a community conference intended for collaboration in the developer community.
          </p>

          <p>
            We value the participation of each member of the Python community and want all attendees
            to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected
            to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all
            conference events, whether officially sponsored by Python.PH or not.
          </p>

          <p>
            To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers
            and volunteers at any PyCon event are required to conform to the following Code of
            Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

            Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and
            expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
            religion, status, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
            following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
            events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
          </p>

          <p>
            Participants who are asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
            immediately.
          </p>

          <p>
            Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other
            exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive
            jokes are not appropriate for PyCon.
          </p>

          <p>
            Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also
            subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized
            images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use
            sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any
            action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the
            conference with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being
            harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff
            immediately.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conference staff can be identified by t-shirts/special badges/head sets.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local
            law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to
            feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
          </p>

          <p>
            We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and
            conference-related social events.
